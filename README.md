# NU-KE
You work as a lone nuclear scientist at a power plant located on the enemy border. It is your responsibility to keep the facility runningâ€”any deviation from this is severely punished. At the same time, your nearby enemies are eager to steal sensitive information, resources, and even abduct you for interrogation. 

Later on, it should be possible to unlock new areas and receive support from the 'state.' 
Multiplayer could be an option, though more challenging than singleplayer. Couch local multiplayer would be dope. Make sure to include 'Shovel Gang' and weed references.
